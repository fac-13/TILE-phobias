##   PREMISE

You can search your fear and see what the official name for that fear is. The search bar can also be used to see what fears exist!

##   [REQUIREMENTS]

Build a website that uses our own server to autocomplete a text input box.

## THE DATA
We wanted to use data that we couldn't find from an API, so we found the data in list form from Oxford Dictionaries [website](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/phobias-list), converted it into an object and stored it in our data.json file. We used an online json validator to check we had converted it correctly.


## TO RUN THIS PROJECT

First clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fac-13/TILE-phobias.git

```

Then install the dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

##   USER STORIES

As a user, I can:

  - start typing a word and have suggestions of fears starting with that letter
  - click on any of the options and go to a new page that tells you the official name of that phobia
